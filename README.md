## About

üì¢ Announcement:

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This is still an early version.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the integration between fhEVM-native and a fully dockerized centralized KMS.

The KMS encompasses all sub-components, including the gateway, KMS blockchain, and centralized KMS backend. This is still an early version with support for (asynchronous) decryption, and support for reencryption is coming soon.

We are still working on reencryption and are making good progress. üîß Since this is a fully Dockerized version, we will provide you with a more robust, tested, and feature-rich version next week. üöÄ


### What is the Zama KMS for fhEVM
The Zama KMS is a fully decentralized key management solution for TFHE, more specifically [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs), based on a maliciously secure and robust [MPC protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/815).

The system facilitates this through a the use of blockchain which provides a means of fulfilling payments to the MPC parties, along with providing an immutable audit log.

Interaction with the same KMS will happen either through an external Ethereum blockchain (fhEVM), providing an API via a smart contract, or through a gateway service.

### Main features
Please consult the [design specification](design.md) for details.

### Implementation

The KMS is implemented as a gRPC service using the [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) crate.
Communication between full nodes and the KMS service is defined by [protobuf](/proto/kms.proto) messages.
The rest of the communication is defined by existing standards and uses JSON-RPC.
For the light client, we currently use CometBFT's [light](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cometbft/cometbft/light) package, which provides a service that connects to any CometBFT full node to serve trusted state roots on-demand.
The light client package handles the logic of sequentially verifying block headers.

## Installation
Docker images that a ready for use can be found [here](https://github.com/zama-ai/kms/actions/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml).

## Getting started

### Key generation

 Please update `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`. Default is `false`

| KEY_GEN | Purpose                                                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| true    | FHE keys are generated on the fly in res/keys (requires at elast 15GB of RAM) |
| false   | FHE keys are copied from kms-service-dev image in res/keys                    |




### Fast run and test

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Init node and copy or gen fhe keys
make init-ethermint-node
# Run fhEVM + full KMS components 
make run-full
# Deploy ACL, Gateway ..., please wait until the end before testing!!!
make prepare-e2e-test
# This test will fail (first event catch is buggy - we are on it)
make run-async-test
# This one is working
make run-async-test
# A non trivial test
make run-true-input-async-test
# Manual test
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint32'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint64'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt several addresses'
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you get `override the existing name orchestrator [y/N]: `, just ^C and  run `make clean-node-storage` to remove the state.

# Init fhEVM-native

```bash
make init-ethermint-node 
```

Initialize and generate/copy FHE keys based on `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`.

> [!NOTE]  
> If KEY_GEN is set to `false`, ensure to have 15 GB of empty RAM to generate the keys. On Mac, do not forget to increase the allocated RAM to docker process. 

### Run fhEVM-native + KMS components

```bash
make run-full
# Check the logs for the node
docker logs zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1 -f
# Check logs for Gateway
docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f     
```

You should see the following docker images:

```
zama-dev-gateway-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.7.1
zama-dev-connector-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-connector-dev:v0.7.1
zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/ethermint-node:v0.5.0
zama-dev-kms-core-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-service-dev:v0.7.1
zama-dev-kms-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-asc-dev:v0.7.1
zama-dev-gateway-store-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.7.1
```

### Stop fhEVM-native + KMS 

```bash
make stop-full
```

### Fresh start

```bash
make clean
```

> [!NOTE]  
> FHE keys are in res/keys folder, delete them to regenerate new keys at ```make init-ethermint-node``` step.


### Test using fhevm

```bash
# if not executed before
make init-ethermint-node 
# if not executed before
make run-full
# In new terminal
make run-e2e-test
```

or in one command 

```bash
make e2e-test
```

## Working with KMS

### Disclaimers

#### Audits
The Zama KMS is not yet audited and should be considered in the early alpha stage. Known bugs and security issues are present as reflected by issue tracking.

#### Parameters
The default parameters for the Zama KMS are chosen to ensure a failure probability of 2^-64 and symmetric equivalent security of 128 bits.

#### Side-channel attacks

Mitigation for side-channel attacks has not been implemented directly in the Zama KMS. The smart contract of the blockchain from which calls originate is responsible to ensure the validity of calls. In particular that new ciphertexts are correctly constructed (through a proof-of-knowledge).
